Wrapper Procedures

<SPAN CLASS="Text1">

<P>
There are a number of procedures, which reside in the top-level directory that are used to start 
up the ADE tools. They'll typically check the environment they are being invoked from and, in some 
cases, provide a trap for a ERROR conditions, and/or pass parameters on to the tools they call. 
Any new ADE tools should have startup procedures modeled after these wrapper procedures as necessary.
