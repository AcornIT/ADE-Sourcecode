<h3>Compile</h3>

<p>This way of compiling will additionally display any warnings, even for a
succesful compile.</p>

<h3>Compile Listing</h3>

<p>Progress compile listing is very useful for seeing the full program with all
include files expanded.</p>

<h3>Debug list</h3>

<p>Similar to compile listing.</p>

<h3>Preprocess</h3>

<p>Additionally to expanding all include-files all preprocessor statements will
be expanded. This is what Progress uses for final compilation.</p>

<h3>String Xref</h3>

<p>Listing all hardcoded &quot;strings&quot;.</p>

<h3>Xref Compile</h3>

<p>Progress XREF compile has references to queries index use and various other
stuff.</p>
