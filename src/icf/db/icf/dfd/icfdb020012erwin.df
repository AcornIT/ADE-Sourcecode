ADD TABLE "gsc_custom_procedure"
  DESCRIPTION "This table is contained in Dynamics for backward compatibility and will likely be dropped at a later stage. It will be replaced with flows and events when these are fully implemented.

The purpose of this table is to provide a mechanism to define alternate procedures for custom specific business logic.

This table contains a list of all the system supported procedures that satisfy these business rules, categorised by entity and procedure type. A number of variations for each process may exist - the procedure to use in each case must be selected from this list.

The programs that these procedures exist in will run persistently when required."

ADD TABLE "gsc_deploy_dataset"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the sets of data that need to be deployed to end-user sites and migrated to different workspace databases. Usually it is static data that needs to be deployed. This table with its child table gsc_dataset_entity identify which data must be deployed as a set, i.e. has dependancies. For example, in order to deploy menu items, objects on the menu item would also need to be deployed.

These tables also define the dataset for deployment of logical objects managed by the scm tool, e.g. the ryc_smartobject and related tables.

To deploy and load the data, xml files will be generated for the dataset.

The dataset must always have a main table that is being deployed, plus all related tables that need to be deployed with it, together with appropriate join information.

Example datasets could be for SmartObjects, menus, objects, etc. It is likely that a seperate dataset will be defined for most data tables that need to be deployed, but that these datasets will include a parent dataset that includes this dataset.

When automatically generating triggers from ERWin an entity-level UDP (DeployData) is used to indicate whether trigger code should be generated for the static tables to support data deployment. A flag also exists in the entity mnemonic table called deploy_data for the same purpose.

For customer sites that receive a dataset deployment, the last deployment loaded for this dataset is record here. This helps identify at what version the current static data is for a particular database.

Customers should not modify or deploy from datasets sent by suppliers. The customer can however create their own datasets containing the same tables and deploy from these datasets. As a dataset deployment includes an xml file registered as part of the deployment, the customer can simply utilise this xml file for their database and any subsequent databases and sites they wish to pass the data on to."

  DESCRIPTION "When certain tables are deployed, the target repository must only be updated with details of new records - it must never modify the value of existing records. This is a logical field to support that functionality, defaulting to NO. An example of a tables that require this field are gsc_sequence and gsc_session_type where we must not overwrite customers data, but must add new records for ones that do not exist.
Currently the functionality for sequences is hard coded. This change removes the hard coding and also facilitates the functionality for additional tables.
We need to have this information stored in the repository to support new automated deployment and load options planned without user intervention.

  DESCRIPTION "We need to identify which tables in the repository are master tables that must have version change information recorded in the gst_record_version table to be able to identify when data has changed and needs to be deployed.
We only need to track changes to master tables. For child data linked to a master table, it is the master record that must be recorded as being changed, not the child table. For example, in the case of repository objects, the ryc_smartobject table is the master table, and all related tables such as pages, links, etc. linked to this will point at the ryc_smartobject entity as the master table. Any modifications to any data in any of these child tables will result in an updated version record for the master ryc_smartobject table in gst_record_version highlighting this master object has changed. This is because it is assumed that any changes to child data of a master object are in fact changes to the master object itself. The changes to the master object and all its child data will be deployed in the dataset(s) defined for the master object.
This will save a lot of redundant data in the gst_record_version table. 
If the join is not specified, i.e. the field is blank, then this is a master entity, otherwise it must identify the master entity for this table.
The specification of this information is specifically for record versioning purposes.

The summary description will be shown first, with an option to display a fuller description if available.

The use of error codes from this table facilitates the customisation of error messages.

This table now supports any kind of message to the user. No messages should be hard coded in the application at all, every message to the user should be channelled through here. Supported message types are:

MES = Message
INF = Information
ERR = Error
WAR = Warning
QUE = Question

The default is ERR for Error if nothing is set-up.

Errors in multiple langages are also supported if required.

ADD TABLE "gsc_instance_attribute"

For example, a generic object could be developed that behaved differently in a creditors and debtors system. An instance attribute of creditor or debtor could be posted to the program when run to determine its instance specific functionality.

The instance attribute will be posted to the program either via the menu option the program was run from, as setup in the menu option, or hard coded in a program if the program was run from a button, etc.

For this reason, certain instance attributes will be system owned and cannot be maintained / deleted by users.

When security structures e.g. field security are setup, they may be defined globally, for a specific product, product module or down to individual program level. The instance attribute is a level below the program level that permits security settings per instance of a program.

Instance attributes will also be used for reporting to allow reports to be printed direct from menu options. The instance attribute code must map to the report_procedure_name in the report_definition table. Whenever a report definition is created, an instance attribute should automatically be created to facilitate this functionality.

The physical service will determine the actual connection parameters.

Which physical service is used is determined by combining the session type with the logical service.

Logical services for appserver service types would in fact be appserver partition names. Logical services for database connection service types would be the logical database name.

When objects are created, they must be assigned an object type.

The object type is used as a grouping mechanism for security, to allow restrictions to be created for certain types of objects, rather than having to setup security for every object.

A recursive join exists for the object type to facilitate definition of object type hierarchies (class hieararchies). This is then useful for attribute inheritance at multiple levels of object type.

For example, an object type could be defined for a fill-in, then a child of this may be an integer fill-in, then a child of this may be an object id, etc.

the extends object type means the inherit from object type.

For example, if this is a service type for database connections, then the datafield may allow the specifiction of -S -N and -H prompts independantly and then put the result as 1 field into the connection parameter.

The management object is the api procedure that is responsible for making the physical connections to the service.

In the case of an appserver partition, the default logical service could point at the default logical appserver partition to use.

ADD TABLE "gsm_flow_step"

Each step may involve the running of an object, the running of an internal procedure within an object, or the execution of another complete flow.

The flow steps may be customised for specific login organisations so that entire steps may be replaced with custom specific code. 

The standard flow steps will be specified with a 0 login company. Within a single flow the login company can either be 0 or a specific company. When running each step it will first check for a customisation for the login company and if not found will just run the standard step. 

If a customisation is found, this may either be an additional step in which case the custom step will be run first, or else it will be a complete replacement of the standard step.

It is also possible to add custom steps that do not have any standard code at all, i.e. no step with a 0 login company exists. This facilitates adding customisations after the standard behaviour.





 and so setting up company specific steps would involve copying the default flow steps to a specific login company in full and then customising the specific steps as required. If the standard flow is modified, customised steps would also need to be manually modified as appropriate.

ADD TABLE "gsm_login_company"
  DESCRIPTION "This framework table defines login companies (organisations) and is used to provide a list of valid companies the user may log into at runtime.

It is intended that this table will link into an external application database where additional details will be stored for the login company, e.g. address and contact information. The code or the object field could be used as the xref into the external application database.

The table is required in the framework to facilitate the generic set-up of framework data specific to login companies, e.g. security allocations, automatic reference numbers, etc.

The existence of a login company in the framework supports the concept of holding multiple company application data in a single database as apposed to having separate databases for each company. Application databases would further have to link to this table or a corresponding table in their database design to filter appropriate data for each login company.

We only hold on this table the minimum details as required by the framework. Applications that also have an organisation table will need to replicate modifications from their full organisation table into this table in order to simplify and syncrhonise maintenance of this data.

For this to work, a menu toolbar must exist with an instance attribute of menu. It does not need to be visualised but must exist. The reason is that it would be too dangerous to just propagate links direct from a container.

Selecting the menu item will propogate any specified links to/from the menu toolbar through to the program being run, thereby bypassing the menu toolbar. The link could also be further directed by the program to an object in the program if an additional link existed between the container and the object with the same link name.

For example, we could have a link from a browserA to a menu toolbar called link1-target. The toolbar runs a new program B. If link1-target is in the list of propogate links, then a link will be created between  browserA and programB. If programB has a subsequent link1-target link from its container to another object called viewerC, then the link will actually be routed from browserA to viewerC.

This in effect is a generic pass through link mechanism.

For range security to be activated, entries must be created in the security structure table, as it is this table that is allocated to users, and allows the range security to be restricted or different in various parts of the application.

Usually developers will create appropriate ranges, and users may then assign them to certain parts of the application via the security structure table.

For example, an AppServer may require a shared memory connection to the repository database whereas a client session would require a network connection to the same databases. The physical connection parameters are different for each of these. Therefore the logical service identifies the database that needs to be connected and the physical service describes the mechanism for the connection dependant on the session type.

If no session service record exists then the logical service can only run locally.

ADD TABLE "gsm_session_type"
  DESCRIPTION "A session type is a namespace for grouping specific types of sessions together.

For example, a ""receipting workstation"" would be a specific session type while a ""salesman's web agent"" could be another.

Each session type is combined with a physical session type that maps to a list of known Progress 4GL run-time environments. 

Thus, ""receipting workstation"" may be mapped to a 4GL GUI client while ""salesman's web agent"" could be mapped to a WebSpeed Transaction Agent.

Thus you could create any number of session types mapping them to specific 4GL session types.

Where different managers, etc. need to be pre-started for different applications, then the different applications would be defined as new session types.

In order to run locally without appserver connections, etc. you would need to define a new session type that connects to appropriate databases and has no session service records for the appserver logical services thereby forcing them to not connect and rather simply use the session handle for code portability. Also, this new session type would define a different set of managers to run, i.e. run the server side managers locally.

We will provide a facility to change the session type on the fly (if possible).

We have a recursive join to the gsc_session_type table to support inheritance of settings across multiple session types. This will make the modification, re-use and creation of session types much simpler. The program that generates the icfconfig.xml file will simply read the extra details from the linked session types and write out an accumulated set of configuration details.

This table also holds parameter details for the session, such as whether to support failover and inactivity timeouts for sessions."

  DESCRIPTION "The actual valid status codes are set-up in the category table. For example:

related entity mnemonic = GSMST for gsm_status
category type = STS for Status
category group = HST for History
category subgroup = COD for Code

The category subgroup is the actual status in this case. The categories of status will always be system owned and mandatory. The category mandatory flag will be used to indicate whether an object at this status may be modified.

At least 1 record must exist in this table for every category subgroup that has a related entity mnemonic of status (GSMST). This record will be system owned, have a sequence of 0 and may not be deleted. It will always be the default status for this category subgroup.

This table allows users to modify the narrative of the status, and add extra status's within the same category subgroup to represent their internal business processes.

From a business logic point of view, when the status changes within the same category, we do not need to do anything and the user may do this manually via a combo box. The change of status from 1 category to the next within a category group will usually be done via a business logic process.

We will always need to join back to the category table to determine what status an object is at from a business logic point of view.

The status an object is at effective from a specific date is determined by an entry in the status history table, which means the status does not need to be added to every table it is used for. However, in some cases we have linked objects directly to the status table to show the current status for performance reasons."

The software will only check security providing a valid enabled token exists for the button label or tab folder page.

If a user has no tokens allocated at all, then it is assumed they have full access (providing security contol is set to full access by default). Once a user is allocated tokens, then security comes into force and the user will only be granted access for folder pages and buttons they have been granted access to (an that have restricted access set up).

Example tokens would be add, delete, modify, view, copy, page 1, page 2, etc.

If the organisation_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all companies. Likewise, if the user_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all users logged into this company. User security will always override company security. In addition, and owning_obj of 0 always indicates no access to all the data for that entity mnemonic (not supported for security structures, or menus - only really for data).

This table generically assigns all security options for the user / company. The standard options that may be specified via the owning_entity_mnemonic and owning_obj are:

gsm_security_structure records for security relating to tokens, fields and ranges.
gsm_menu_items for securing access to menu items
gsm_menu_structure for securing access to menu structures
gsm_entity_field_value for securing access to generic entity field values e.g. companies.

Additionally, access to any entity data can be secured using this table. For example, to secure access to specific cost centre codes in a general ledger, the owning_entity_mnemonic could be the cost centre table, and the owning_obj used to allocate specific cost centres the user / company has access to.

The rules applied to this table for the entity in order are as follows:
0) If security is disabled, then user security is passed.
1) If a specific record exists for the user / company then security is passed
2) If a specific record is found for the user / company with an owning_obj of     0, security is failed
3) If not full access by default, and no entries exist for the user at all, including     all users and all companies, security is failed
4) If a record exists for all users or all companies with an owning_obj of 0,     then security is failed
5) If a record is found for all users, security is passed
6) If a record is found for all companies, security is passed
7) If full access by default and no records are found at all for the specific     user, all users, or all companies, then security is passed.

Some allocations require additional data, e.g. allocating a field restriction needs to determine what can be done with the field, e.g. View, Update, Hide, etc.

Entries must exist in this table for all security allocations. There is no option for inclusion or exclusion to make querying as fast as possible. The maintenance programs however should allow the specification by inclusion or exclusion for fast data entry - then create / delete all relevant entries in this table.

ADD TABLE "gst_record_version"
  DESCRIPTION "This table provides the means for identifying when static data is changed and needs to be deployed. 

When an item of data on a record changes, the replication trigger on the table will check if the version_data flag on the gsc_entity_mnemonic table is switched on. 

If the flag is on, either a record is written to this table or an existing record in the table is updated to indicate that the data has changed by incrementing the version_number_seq and resetting date, time and user. 

This table is checked every time the deployment data is written to ensure that all data that matches the deployment criteria is written out.

Basically any records with a version_number_seq greater than 0 has been changed locally and potentially needs to be deployed. Once an import is done for a record, the version_number_seq is set back to 0 indicating the data matches that since the last import and has not been modified since.

When importing data, the import_version_number_seq is used as a validity check and if this number does not match the import_version_number_seq of the data being imported or the current version_number_seq does not match, there is a potential conflict.

This will mean that where object ids are used for keys, we will also store some other unique key information about the table if available, that would have been used as an alternative by the deployment procedures to locate the record. For example, in the case of the ryc_smartobject table, the key_field_value will contain the smartobject_obj and the secondary_key_value will contain the actual object name.
We cannot make this field unique as it may not always be used, but it will be indexed together with the entity mnemonic. If the field is used for an entity, then code will prevent duplicate alternate key values as this should never occur due to the new data resurrection functionality this facilitates.
Triggers for master tables will check the gst_record_version table where the secondary field is used and see if a new record is being created with a previously used key value, and if so, will change the object id to match the previously used object id. This will ensure when resurrecting old data that the object id is never modified, and help prevent data conflicts when deploying data.

Its purpose is to be able to record session activity and manage the context for the session in the child table gsm_server_context. The session id field from gsm_server_context has transferred to this table, so it only exists in one place for the session, and the object id for the session record is rather carried down onto the individual context records. This facilitates efficiently fixing the context id in the event a session is dropped and reconnected, thereby restoring context for the new session from the old session. For the Appserver, a record will be created in this table at connection time and checked / updated in the activate procedure.
This table must not have a write trigger so that it can be updated as efficiently as possible.
The information in this table is all client related, and in the case of a WebSpeed Agent, the agent is also the client.

Certain attributes are required for the application to function correctly and these will be set to system owned to prevent accidental deletion. Only users that are classified as able to maintain system owned information may manipulate this data. In many (most) cases, the actual attribute label will need to match to a valid Progress supported attribute.

Due to the powerful feature of allowing attributes to be defined at various levels, most dynamic data about smartobjects will utilise attributes.

Example areas that we will utilise attributes for include browser query, sort order and where clauses, container window titles, which window to run based on various button actions in a browser, e.g. add, modify, view, etc., status bar configuration, page enabling and disabling, field enabling and disabling by object instance, whether toolbar items are included in the menu, etc.

If this field has a value, then the functions to get and/or set this property need to physically exist and be used and overrideable, to allow them to contain additionally logic beyond simply retrieving the value from ADM-DATA. This is the equivalent of defining the xp preprocessors in the ADM but is more flexible in that it differentiates between get and set.

It is the set calls that are most expensive at startup, so this is an important field.

Note that in code when checking this value, a CAN-FIND should be used to ensure the order of the get,set is irrelevant.

  DESCRIPTION "This entity associated attributes with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances, and specifies the value of the attribute in the appropriate native data type or character if a native data type is not available for the data type.

The list of attribute values defined for the object type (class) must be complete, and unless an attribute is defined at the class level, it will not be available to be set within a subclass. Attribute values are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the attribute values for an object, attributes for parent classes must also be read.

Records will then only exist for subclassess in the event the value has been specifically overridden for that subclass.

When creating entries in this table for attributes associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating attributes for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for attributes associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

  DESCRIPTION "The table is required to store possible customization codes as a result of some level of customization. Many types of customization exist, including UI type customizations (e.g. HTML, DHTML, GUI), user category customizations, user customizations, company level customizations, etc as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.  To avoid confusion and to provide some level of control as to the use of the result codes, a result code must be for a specific customization type.

The table will basically contain a code and description field. Meaningful codes and descriptions should be used to avoid conflicting uses of result codes. The table is also joined to the customization type to identify which type of customization the result code is for. 

For user level customizations, example result codes could be individual user login names, e.g. Bruce, Anthony, Don, etc. Alternatively the customization results could be defined rather by job function, e.g. operator, administrator, clerk, etc. For UI type customizations, the result codes could be DHTML, HTML, GUI, PDA, etc. For language customizations, the result codes could be English, French, German, etc. Another possibility is customizations by user category, in which case the result codes would represent valid categories, e.g. data capturer.

This provides maximum flexibility as to how much customization is required. 
The customization types simply define the various levels of supported customization, and the result codes define the possible values each customization type can be. The customization result table could therefore be viewed as a list of valid values for a customization type.
Certain result codes, such as supported UI type customizations will be provided as part of the framework. These result codes will be defined with a system owned flag set to YES, and maintenance of these codes will be restricted to users authorized to maintain system data. Care should be taken when defining these framework supplied result codes to avoid potential conflicts with result codes used by Dynamics applications.

It is envisaged that the number of result codes will be kept to a minimum to make customization more manageable.

SmartDataObjects and other non-visual objects are automatically assigned to row ""0"", since they do not actually appear in any way at runtime.
So for example, a window or page with a Toolbar at the top, and an SDO, followed by a Browser, under that a Viewer, and another Toolbar at the Bottom, would assign to those objects the layout positions ""M11"" for the toolbar, ""M01"" for the SDO, ""M21"" for the Browser, ""M31"" for the Viewer, and ""B11"" for the Bottom Toolbar.

Multiple relationships can exist between the same parent and child table if required, so one of these must be flagged as the primary relationship to use initially when joining between the two tables.

The relationship reference field is unique so that it can be referenced in code if required, where multiple possible relationships exists and application functionality depends on the relationship. Where the relationship reference is irrelevant, it can be automatically generated using the Dynamics sequences.

The attributes about the relationship map closely with the attributes supported by ERWin from Computer Associates.

The fields used to join the tables in the relationship are specified in the child table ryc_relationship_field.

The contents of this table should be automatically populated from information exported from a case tool such as ERwin, to make synchronization of changes as automated as possible.

This table, once populated, can be used to support generic application functionality such as automatic object generation, referential integrity trigger code, etc.

It is envisaged that at some stage in the future, the information in these tables will be replaced with support for relationships in the core language meta schema.

An identifying relationship means that the child table is totally dependant on the parent table. If this flag is set to YES, then the nulls_allowed flag cannot be YES as the join must be mandatory.

A mandatory join however does not necessarily indicate an identifying relationship. To be identifying, the child table really has to be a sub-table of the parent. Where the parent field is simply an attribute of the child table (foreign key) then the relationship is not really identifying.

When using ERwin, if the relationship is flagged as identifying, the foreign key fields are forced into the primary key of the child table, which is not always what you want. For this reason, when using ERwin, most relationships are flagged as non-identifying but no-nulls which has the same affect, just without the forced primary key fields.

The identifying flag is for the most part just for information purposes and to force the setting of the nulls_allowed field. It is really the nulls_allowed field that is the important one.

The join sequence determines the order to reference the fields when constructing a dynamic where clause to join the tables.

When joining to some tables, additional constant values for fields in the child table or parent table may need to be specified and this functionality is supported. 

An example of this in the Dynamics repository is when joining from the gsc_object_type table to the ryc_attribute_value table, where there is a single field from the parent table, the object_type_obj, but we must additionally specify a 0 value for other fields, eg. container_smartobject_obj, smartobject_obj and object_instance_obj. This means that when using constant values, the child or the parent field may be left blank.

ADD TABLE "ryc_ri_default"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the default referential integrity (RI) rules to apply when manually maintaining relationships in the ryc_relationship table.

The rules in this table will be used to default the parent and child actions based on the value of the identifying_relationship and nulls_allowed fields.

The standard set of RI defaults used by Dynamics are as follows:

For identifying and non-identifying but will no nulls the defaults are:
Child Delete = None
Child Insert = Restrict
Child Update = Restrict
Parent Delete = Restrict
Parent Insert = None
Parent Update = Restrict

For non-indentifying but with nulls allowed the defaults are:
Child Delete = None
Child Insert = Set Null
Child Update = Set Null
Parent Delete = Set Null
Parent Insert = None
Parent Update = Set Null

These are usually correct apart from the need to sometimes change the delete rules for the parent to cascade, and soemtimes even when a relationship allows nulls, you still want a restrict rule rather than a set null rule.

ADD TABLE "ryc_smartobject"
  DESCRIPTION "This table represents every object known to the repository, whether static or dynamic. All objects that can be run should be registered in the repository, including all visual objects, business logic, etc. Images for buttons, etc. should also be registered.

The only files not registered in the repository are include files.

Having the files registered allows them to be added as instances to containers, added to menus, have security applied to them, run them as part of flows and events, automate deployment of them, etc.

Many child tables exist to further define an object, and which tables apply depend on the object type. For example, information regarding links, pages, instances, etc. only pertain to objects that are containers. Even with containers, not all tables may apply, as viewers, browsers, and sdo's are containers for datafields but do not have the concept of pages, only window containers have pages, links, etc.

Certain object properties are only applicable to physical objects. Previously this table was broken into two, and th second table, gsc_object used to define physical properties. This was removed in V2 to improve performance and resolve many issues associated with this, hence some redundant fields in certain object types.

For versioning to work, we have turned off RI that would have prevented an object being deleted if it is used on a container - this is to allow imports and object assignments to work. This RI must therefore be manually coded where required.

We turned off the automatic delete cascade of smartobject attributes as it was also deleting attributes for instances of the smartobject when we did not want it to. Added a specific delete trigger customisation that rather joined on the primary_smartobject_obj in the attribute table when deleting attributes, to ensure only attributes for the smartobject were deleted, not also instance attributes.

This table optionally supports customization using custom result codes.The unique key to this table is made up of the object filename and a result code, allowing the same object name to exist with multiple result codes, each custom object containing what behaviour has been added or overridden. The object with a 0 result code is the master default object, and this must always exist.

In this way, any of the fields on this table, plus information in tables where this is the parent may be customized by result code. Tools support for this however may be limited initially.

Whenever reading a smartobject based on the filename, the result code must also be specified, using 0 if looking for the master.

A recursive join with a rolename of extends_smartobject_obj has been added to this table to support inherritance. This functionality however as of V2 has not been implemented into the framework. The intention is to allow objects to inherit from (extend) other objects, therefore facilitating changes to master or template objects being cascaded down to subclasses or instances, by reading up the class structure.

For V2, the inherittance functionality has just been added at the object type level."

This allows the attachment of UI events to dynamic objects.

When creating entries in this table for events associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating events for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for events associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Events are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the events for an object, events for parent classes must also be read."

ADD TABLE "rym_customization"
  DESCRIPTION "This table captures the actual customization results for the various supported types of customization as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.

This table is joined from the ryc_customization_type table with a mandatory join to define the type of customization. It contains a customization_reference field as part of the unique key to store the value for the customization according to the type. For example, if this was a user level customization, then the reference field would contain a specific users login code. If this was a UI type customization, then the reference field would contain the value of a UI type, e.g. HTML, GUI, etc.

This differs from the values in the customization result table. The customization result table is a list of valid value result codes for the customization type. This table represents actual values that can be checked at runtime with the appropriate api and the values may differ to the result code values. The result code values are reusable.

For example, one customization type is user customization. In this customization table we could have a record for each user with the reference pointing at the user login name, e.g. Anthony, john, bruce, etc. The api specified for the customization type would be run to find the current user and lookup in this table what the specified result code is for the user. The result code for Anthony could be manager, and John could also point at the same result code, but Bruce may point at result code engineer. Note the possible reuse of result codes and the difference between the result code values and the customization references.

The table stores the result for the customization via a join to the customization result table, identifying the result code to use for this specific customization.
These tables then provide maximum flexibility for customization possibilities.
As stated previously, the resultant result codes for a session will be evaluated after authentication and made available to the session.

When reading from tables that support customization, e.g. the smartobject and related tables, the appropriate record will be read with a matching result code of the highest priority level, if any matching customizations exist, otherwise the default record will be used.

A generic tool will need to be developed to capture these customizations.

It is used to forward engineer the object into the full Repository, generating all appropriate smartobject instances and attributes. Many assumptions are made regarding the look and feel of a standard ICF TreeView Controller which significantly simplifies the data that must be captured.

More complex specific modifications to an object may be made using the standard Repository Maintenance options.

This table also facilitates generation of the object into different UI's, e.g. Java.

This is a comma-separated paired list of database field names in the Data-Target and RowObject Temp-Table fields in the Data-Source that should be used for opening the Data-Target's database query using one or more key values from the Data-Source.

A good example is joining a customer sdo with an order sdo and the foreign fields would be set to order.cust-num,cust-num.

Note that for each Foreign Field pair, the first entry is the name of the field in the database query for the Data-Target (the child or detail SDO in the parent-child or master-detail relationship), which is Order.CustNum in our example. This first entry is expressed as the database field name (optionally with the table qualifier) because that fieldname will actually be inserted into a where clause used to open the database query for the Data-Target, resulting in FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.CustNum = <CustNum-value-from-Data-Source>. The second entry in the pair is the name of the key field in the Data-Source SDO which is to be compared to the database field in the Target, or CustNum in our case. This must be the name of the field as it occurs in the Data-Source SDO column list (no DB table qualification) because the Source SDO is providing that value from the SDO's temp-table, not straight out of the database. Each time the dataAvailable event is published by the Data-Source, indicating that its query on Customers has been re-positioned, the Data-Target (Order) SDO will request the value of the CustNum field from the Customer SDO and plug that into the Order query where clause as indicated above.

We need to be able to control and automate what tasks to do as part of the DCU for a specific release, at what stage they should be run, whether each step completed successfully, the order of the steps, etc.

Certain tasks can only occur after the DCU has finished, but before anybody starts using the system and the tasks require a valid login to complete. Currently we have no way of controlling or automating this, which is the primary reason for the table. This table will significantly improve the load-n-go functionality within Dynamics and help prevent migration and deployment issues.

The DCU will update this table from the information in the .pfl file that the DCU uses as the source of the information for the DCU.
