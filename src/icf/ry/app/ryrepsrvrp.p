  Description:  Astra Server Repository Manager

  Purpose:      This is the actual Server Side Repository Manager.
                The actual code for the Repository Manager is contained in the 
                include file ry/app/ryrepmngrp.i
                This code is also used by the Client Side Repository Manager
                ry/prc/ryrepclntp.p
                Server side and client side code is conditionally included using
                the pre-processors server-side and client-side.
                This is not a structured include and contains no wizards as it
                contains no specific code other than the definition of a 
                pre-processor and an include file containing the actual code.

  Parameters:   <none>
