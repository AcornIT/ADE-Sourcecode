To ensure that data integrity remains for each Dynamics installation, each site or location running Dynamics must be identified by a unique number worldwide. In addition, a unique site number is required for every instance/installment of the product. PSC hosts the Dynamics Site Number Allocation application so that you can reserve unique numbers for your Dynamics installation.
