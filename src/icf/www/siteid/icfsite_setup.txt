This is a basic web application for the ICF Site number allocation.
I have not used any style sheets, javascript or images.

To install:
Create a empty database.
Load the .df file.
Load the .d files.
Setup a webspeed broker that connects to the database.
Add the path of the directory containing the source file in the PROPATH.

Add a shortcut link to a web page to start the application:
i.e.
<A HREF='/webspeed/cgiip.exe/WService=wsb_icfsite/icfsite.w?wRun=RunFrames'>ICF Site Control</A>

Replace the "wsb_icfsite" name with your webspeed broker name.

Launch the application and off you go.
