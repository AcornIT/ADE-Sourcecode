ADD TABLE "gsc_deploy_dataset"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the sets of data that need to be deployed to end-user sites and migrated to different workspace databases. Usually it is static data that needs to be deployed. This table with its child table gsc_dataset_entity identify which data must be deployed as a set, i.e. has dependancies. For example, in order to deploy menu items, objects on the menu item would also need to be deployed.

These tables also define the dataset for deployment of logical objects managed by the scm tool, e.g. the ryc_smartobject and related tables.

To deploy and load the data, xml files will be generated for the dataset.

The dataset must always have a main table that is being deployed, plus all related tables that need to be deployed with it, together with appropriate join information.

Example datasets could be for SmartObjects, menus, objects, etc. It is likely that a seperate dataset will be defined for most data tables that need to be deployed, but that these datasets will include a parent dataset that includes this dataset.

When automatically generating triggers from ERWin an entity-level UDP (DeployData) is used to indicate whether trigger code should be generated for the static tables to support data deployment. A flag also exists in the entity mnemonic table called deploy_data for the same purpose.

For customer sites that receive a dataset deployment, the last deployment loaded for this dataset is record here. This helps identify at what version the current static data is for a particular database.

Customers should not modify or deploy from datasets sent by suppliers. The customer can however create their own datasets containing the same tables and deploy from these datasets. As a dataset deployment includes an xml file registered as part of the deployment, the customer can simply utilise this xml file for their database and any subsequent databases and sites they wish to pass the data on to."

For example, a generic object could be developed that behaved differently in a creditors and debtors system.

The instance attribute will be posted to the program either via the menu option the program was run from, as setup in the menu option, or hard coded in a program if the program was run from a button, etc.

For this reason, certain instance attributes will be system owned and cannot be maintained / deleted by users.

When security structures e.g. field security are setup, they may be defined globally, for a specific product, product module or down to individual program level. The instance attribute is a level below the program level that permits security settings per instance of a program.

Instance attributes will also be used for reporting to allow reports to be printed direct from menu options. The instance attribute code must map to the report_procedure_name in the report_definition table. Whenever a report definition is created, an instance attribute should automatically be created to facilitate this functionality.

ADD TABLE "gsc_object"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the objects (programs) that exist within your applications. Not every program needs to be added as an object - only programs that require security, or that need to appear on a dynamic menu need be setup.

Objects must be assigned an object type and belong to a product module. This facilitates setting up security based on object types and modules, rather than having to secure every object individually.

This table now supports both physical and logical objects. If the object is a physical object, then the link to the physical object will be set to 0. If the object is a dynamic object, then the link to the physical object will point at the object to use as the starting point when building the dynamic object.

If the object is flagged as a generic object, i.e. a physical object that is the basis for dynamic objects, then no security allocations, menus, etc. may be allocated to it as it is useless without the dynamic portions being built first against the logical objects that use it.

For logical objects, the object name will be specified without a file extension, and the path will not be relevant.

This repository concept means that many more objects will exist in this table.

The object type is used as a grouping mechanism for security, to allow restrictions to be created for certain types of objects, rather than having to setup security for every object.

A recursive join exists for the object type to facilitate definition of object type hierarchies (class hieararchies). This is then useful for attribute inheritance at multiple levels of object type.

The maintenance object defines the datafield object used to maintain the physical connection parameter attribute on the physical service table. For example, if this is a service type for database connections, then the datafield may allow the specifiction of -S -N and -H prompts independantly and then put the result as 1 field into the connection parameter.

The management object is the api procedure that is responsible for making the physical connections to the service.

In the case of an appserver partition, the default logical service could point at the default logical appserver partition to use.

  DESCRIPTION "This table registers a deployment created for a dataset, when it was created, by whom, whether it was a baseline including all data or whether it was incremental data including only data that had changed, plus the xml file that contains the dumped data.

Deployments should only be created for datasets created and owned by your site. If a dataset is owned by another site, then you should use the xml file to load data and pass data on to other sites. If you wish to create your own xml files, then simply create a new dataset with the same tables and deploy from there. This will ensure we can track the versions of data deployed and loaded at the various sites.

The xml file that contains the deployed data should be kept, registered in the SCM tool and deployed as part of the application. This facilitates incremental deployments of only data that has changed.

If this is a baseline deployment, then the xml file will contain all the records in all the tables included in the dataset. If not, it will only contain records that have changed since the last deployment, as idenitified by the information in the gst_record_version table. This version table will only contain version records if the data in the table is being versioned. IF data is not being versioned, then the xml file will always have to contain the full data in the table.

Each step may involve the running of an object, the running of an internal procedure within an object, or the execution of another complete flow.

The flow steps may be customised for specific login organisations so that entire steps may be replaced with custom specific code. 

The standard flow steps will be specified with a 0 login company. Within a single flow the login company can either be 0 or a specific company. When running each step it will first check for a customisation for the login company and if not found will just run the standard step. 

If a customisation is found, this may either be an additional step in which case the custom step will be run first, or else it will be a complete replacement of the standard step.

It is also possible to add custom steps that do not have any standard code at all, i.e. no step with a 0 login company exists. This facilitates adding customisations after the standard behaviour.





 and so setting up company specific steps would involve copying the default flow steps to a specific login company in full and then customising the specific steps as required. If the standard flow is modified, customised steps would also need to be manually modified as appropriate.

It is intended that this table will link into an external application database where additional details will be stored for the login company, e.g. address and contact information. The code or the object field could be used as the xref into the external application database.

The table is required in the framework to facilitate the generic set-up of framework data specific to login companies, e.g. security allocations, automatic reference numbers, etc.

The existence of a login company in the framework supports the concept of holding multiple company application data in a single database as apposed to having separate databases for each company. Application databases would further have to link to this table or a corresponding table in their database design to filter appropriate data for each login company.

We only hold on this table the minimum details as required by the framework. Applications that also have an organisation table will need to replicate modifications from their full organisation table into this table in order to simplify and syncrhonise maintenance of this data.

For this to work, a menu toolbar must exist with an instance attribute of menu. It does not need to be visualised but must exist. The reason is that it would be too dangerous to just propagate links direct from a container.

Selecting the menu item will propogate any specified links to/from the menu toolbar through to the program being run, thereby bypassing the menu toolbar. The link could also be further directed by the program to an object in the program if an additional link existed between the container and the object with the same link name.

For example, we could have a link from a browserA to a menu toolbar called link1-target. The toolbar runs a new program B. If link1-target is in the list of propogate links, then a link will be created between  browserA and programB. If programB has a subsequent link1-target link from its container to another object called viewerC, then the link will actually be routed from browserA to viewerC.

This in effect is a generic pass through link mechanism.

For example, an AppServer may require a shared memory connection to the repository database whereas a client session would require a network connection to the same databases. The physical connection parameters are different for each of these. Therefore the logical service identifies the database that needs to be connected and the physical service describes the mechanism for the connection dependant on the session type.

If no session service record exists then the logical service can only run locally.

ADD TABLE "gsm_session_type"
  DESCRIPTION "A session type is a namespace for grouping specific types of sessions together.

For example, a ""receipting workstation"" would be a specific session type while a ""salesman's web agent"" could be another.

Each session type is combined with a physical session type that maps to a list of known Progress 4GL run-time environments. 

Thus, ""receipting workstation"" may be mapped to a 4GL GUI client while ""salesman's web agent"" could be mapped to a WebSpeed Transaction Agent.

Thus you could create any number of session types mapping them to specific 4GL session types.

Where different managers, etc. need to be pre-started for different applications, then the different applications would be defined as new session types.

In order to run locally without appserver connections, etc. you would need to define a new session type that connects to appropriate databases and has no session service records for the appserver logical services thereby forcing them to not connect and rather simply use the session handle for code portability. Also, this new session type would define a different set of managers to run, i.e. run the server side managers locally.

We will provide a facility to change the session type on the fly (if possible).

ADD TABLE "gsm_site"
  DESCRIPTION "This table contain sites or locations where ICF software is running.

Its use is to make certain data specific to a particular site, e.g. menu items, menu structures, report definitions, report formats, etc. specific to ICF. It can further define data specific to product and product modules.

Sites could be further broken down to provide additional filtering by site location if required.

Sites can either be development sites or customer sites. Only development sites need a unique site number.

Every site you intend to deploy data to needs to be set up in this table as the site is used to track deployments.

Every site must be allocated a totally unique number worldwide. This number will then be used as part of the object numbers in any databases used by that site for ICF applications.

This will mean that you can safely deploy data to sites without fear of having conflicting object numbers. Any data modified by the site will never be overwritten as the object numbers will never clash. Also data could be returned to us safely with no fear of object number clashes.

The site number must be uniqe worldwide to facilitate software houses developing with ICF releasing data to other software houses developing with ICF

The ICFDB will contain two sequences, seq_site_reverse and seq_site_division that will have their current value set by the allocation of the site number. They will then never be changed, and the current value of the sequences used to calculate the decimal portion of the object number, making the object numbers unique within that site. See the description of the site number for details of the calculations required.

A site will only ever have one version of the ICFDB database, ensuring they keep the same site number for all their ICF products.

Any object numbers that do not conform to this new standard should be fixed immediately to avoid problems in the future.

The data is linked to a site via the gsm_site_specific table in the ICFDB database which supports any type of data. The data being filtered is identified by the owning entity mnemonic, and the specific reference identifies the actual item of data being filtered. It is possible to make an item of data available to many sites. If the item of data does not exist in the table, then it will be assumed the data is applicable to all sites.

The gsm_site_specific table is also used to allocate which sites a specific user is associated with. In this case the entity mnemonic would be GSMUS and the specific reference would be the user login name.

Examples of data that may be specific to site codes are menu items, menu structures, report definitions and report formats.

For any supported tables, e.g. menu items when building menus, a check will need to be made in the site specific data table for the appropriate entity mnemonic and unique reference. If any records exist at all, then the site codes allocated to the user must be checked to see that the user has a matching site code. If not, the data should be skipped over as it is not relevant.

This table is in ICFDB because it is not specific to any product or workspace. The site specific data table is in ICFDB because it relates to the specific product and workspace data, allowing different workspaces to support different configurations of site specific data.

The current site can always be found by checking the value of the site sequence."

ADD FIELD "site_number" OF "gsm_site" AS INTEGER
  DESCRIPTION "A unique number worldwide to identify the site and to be used as the decimal portion of object numbers generated for this site.

To avoid the problem of site 1 and site 10 conflicting due to the decimal portion containing .1 and .10, we use 2 sequences to work out the decimal portion of the site number, whose current values are derived from the site number.

The first sequence (seq_site_reverse) is set to the exact reverse of the site numer digits, e.g. 1 would be 1, 10 would be 01, 100 would be 001, etc.

The second sequence (seq_site_division) is the number to divide by to get a decimal, e.g. 1 would be 10, 10 would be 100, 100 would be 1000, etc.

Therefore 1 divided by 10 gives 0.1, 10 reversed as 01 divided by 100 gives .01, 100 reversed as 001 divided by 1000 gives .001, etc.

The setting of this site number will generate a .d with the sequence current values calculated using the above.

The site number is only applicable to development sites.

From a business logic point of view, when the status changes within the same category, we do not need to do anything and the user may do this manually via a combo box. The change of status from 1 category to the next within a category group will usually be done via a business logic process.

We will always need to join back to the category table to determine what status an object is at from a business logic point of view.

The status an object is at effective from a specific date is determined by an entry in the status history table, which means the status does not need to be added to every table it is used for. However, in some cases we have linked objects directly to the status table to show the current status for performance reasons."

Tokens may be created for any tab page names or button labels, being careful to ignore any shortcut characters and ... suffixes. The tokens must then be added to the security structure table to become active. The security structure table facilitates the token being restricted for a specific object instance, specific object, specific product module, or generically for everything.

The software will only check security providing a valid enabled token exists for the button label or tab folder page.

If a user has no tokens allocated at all, then it is assumed they have full access (providing security contol is set to full access by default). Once a user is allocated tokens, then security comes into force and the user will only be granted access for folder pages and buttons they have been granted access to (an that have restricted access set up).

Example tokens would be add, delete, modify, view, copy, page 1, page 2, etc.

ADD TABLE "gsm_user_allocation"
  DESCRIPTION "When a user logs into the system, they log in with a user id, and a select a company (organisation). This table defines the security options for the user when they log into a certian organisation. The user may have different security options when logged into different companies.

If the organisation_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all companies. Likewise, if the user_obj is 0, then the security allocation applies to all users logged into this company. User security will always override company security. In addition, and owning_obj of 0 always indicates no access to all the data for that entity mnemonic (not supported for security structures, or menus - only really for data).

This table generically assigns all security options for the user / company. The standard options that may be specified via the owning_entity_mnemonic and owning_obj are:

gsm_security_structure records for security relating to tokens, fields and ranges.
gsm_menu_items for securing access to menu items
gsm_menu_structure for securing access to menu structures
gsm_entity_field_value for securing access to generic entity field values e.g. companies.

Additionally, access to any entity data can be secured using this table. For example, to secure access to specific cost centre codes in a general ledger, the owning_entity_mnemonic could be the cost centre table, and the owning_obj used to allocate specific cost centres the user / company has access to.

The rules applied to this table for the entity in order are as follows:
0) If security is disabled, then user security is passed.
1) If a specific record exists for the user / company then security is passed
2) If a specific record is found for the user / company with an owning_obj of     0, security is failed
3) If not full access by default, and no entries exist for the user at all, including     all users and all companies, security is failed
4) If a record exists for all users or all companies with an owning_obj of 0,     then security is failed
5) If a record is found for all users, security is passed
6) If a record is found for all companies, security is passed
7) If full access by default and no records are found at all for the specific     user, all users, or all companies, then security is passed.

Some allocations require additional data, e.g. allocating a field restriction needs to determine what can be done with the field, e.g. View, Update, Hide, etc.

Entries must exist in this table for all security allocations. There is no option for inclusion or exclusion to make querying as fast as possible. The maintenance programs however should allow the specification by inclusion or exclusion for fast data entry - then create / delete all relevant entries in this table.

create
delete
write
find
replication-create

Standard checks are included into triggers via the include file af/sup2/aftrgover.i which references this table and does a can find check on the table name, the transaction id (from dbtaskid) and also checks for a date range of 2 days from the current system date to ensure we do not find redundant data.

A transaction id as generated from the dbtaskid statement. This is used so that the override functionality only works within the context of a single transaction.

Records must therefore be created in this table within the same transaction that the triggers need to be overridden.

Extra information is included in the table for audit purposes to track down problem areas if records get left in this table.

One area where this is used is when dumping / loading data via xml files for deployment datasets that require ri triggers to be disabled.

The link could also be further directed by the program to an object in the program if an additional link existed between the container and the object with the same link name.

For example, we could have a link from a browserA to a toolbar called link1-target. The toolbar runs a new program B. If link1-target is in the list of propogate links, then a link will be created between  browserA and programB. If programB has a subsequent link1-target link from its container to another object called viewerC, then the link will actually be routed from browserA to viewerC.

Certain attributes are required for the application to function correctly and these will be set to system owned to prevent accidental deletion. Only users that are classified as able to maintain system owned information may manipulate this data. In many cases, the actual attribute label will need to match to a valid Progress supported attribute.

Default attributes may be defined for the various smartobject types in the type attribute table, plus additional attributes allocated for each instance of a smartobject, thus the types define default bahaviour that may be overriden and extended for each instance.

Due to the powerful feature of allowing attributes to be defined at various levels, most dynamic data about smartobjects will utilise attributes.

Example areas that we will utilise attributes for include browser query, sort order and where clauses, container window titles, which window to run based on various button actions in a browser, e.g. add, modify, view, etc., status bar configuration, page enabling and disabling, field enabling and disabling by object instance, whether toolbar items are included in the menu, etc.

Where the attribute is associated with an object type or a smartobject, then the attribute value will reflect a default value. where the attribute is associated with an instance of a smartobject, then the value will reflect an actual value.

When creating entries in this table for attributes associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating attributes for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for attributes associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Where an attribute is defined as a collection, then attribute values can be linked together. The ""attribute_value"" field of the collection attribute_value record will be the number of elements in the collection, and this will then parent each of the attribute value records in the collection by collection sequence.

Where attribute values are defined for object types and smartobjects, these values will be cascaded down to actual smartobject instances for performance reasons. Any future modifications of these values will also be cascaded down to all instances where the inherrited_value is set to YES, therefore ensuring we do not overwrite manual changes made at an instance level.

a) If the toolbar parent menu is a real submenu rather than the menubar then this submenu will be used.
b) If the toolbar parent menu is the menubar, then we will use the first submenu on the menubar. If no submenus yet exist at all, then we will create one called FILE by default.

When adding submenus for a toolbar, we need to determine where we should parent this toolbar submenus to, i.e which submenu to hook onto if any.

ADD TABLE "ryc_smartobject"
  DESCRIPTION "This entity represents every smartobject known to the repository, whether static or dynamic.

Relationships exist to various child tables; however the existence of data in these child tables corresponding to this particular smartobject is dictated by the smartobject type - e.g. only Toolbar smartobjects may have toolbar group data.

Some smartobjects are visualisations of data provided by a smartdataobject.  This is represented by the cyclic relationship ""provides data for"".

NOTE: Every ICF object will be automatically created in this table to make it easy to use a mixture of static and dynamic objects onto static or dynamic containers. The creation of these records should therefore be done by the appropriate wizards, etc.

NOTE2: We have turned off the delete trigger RI to prevent an object being deleted if it is on a container somewhere - to allow our imports and assignments of the data in the versioning system to work. Therefore, this RI must be manually coded wherever it is possible to delete a smartobject, to ensure smartobjects that exist on containers are not inadvertantly deleted.

NOTE3: We turned off the automatic delete cascade of smartobject attributes as it was also deleting attributes for instances of the smartobject when we did not want it to. Added a specific delete trigger customisation that rather joined on the primary_smartobject_obj in the attribute table when deleting attributes, to ensure only attributes for the smartobject were deleted, not also instance attributes."

Certain information is specific to certain types of objects, but is contained in a central table for performance and simplicity reasons, and to reduce the number of tables required by the repository.

The table defines the fields for a smartdataobject which are all the fields available to any objects using the smartdataobject.

When the fields are related to anything other than a smartdataobject, certain of the values only need to be specified if they differ from the default values defined in the smartdataobject fields, thereby facilitating the override of default values per instance.

Holding this information in the repository removes the dependany on the Progress system tables (underscore tables) and also allows us to add extra information required by the repository. We provide import tables to automatically create a lot of this information directly from existing objects, and wizards on the smartdataobject to populate the data for new objects.

  DESCRIPTION "This entity stores information about UI events for a smartobject. It works very similar to the ryc_attribute_value table in that UI events can be associated with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances.

Where the event is associated with an object type or a smartobject, then the event will reflect a default action. where the event is associated with an instance of a smartobject, then the action will reflect an actual action.

When creating entries in this table for events associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating events for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for events associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Where events are defined for object types and smartobjects, these values will be cascaded down to actual smartobject instances for performance reasons. Any future modifications of these values will also be cascaded down to all instances where the inherrited_value is set to YES, therefore ensuring we do not overwrite manual changes made at an instance level.

This is a comma-separated paired list of database field names in the Data-Target and RowObject Temp-Table fields in the Data-Source that should be used for opening the Data-Target's database query using one or more key values from the Data-Source.

A good example is joining a customer sdo with an order sdo and the foreign fields would be set to order.cust-num,cust-num.

Note that for each Foreign Field pair, the first entry is the name of the field in the database query for the Data-Target (the child or detail SDO in the parent-child or master-detail relationship), which is Order.CustNum in our example. This first entry is expressed as the database field name (optionally with the table qualifier) because that fieldname will actually be inserted into a where clause used to open the database query for the Data-Target, resulting in FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.CustNum = <CustNum-value-from-Data-Source>. The second entry in the pair is the name of the key field in the Data-Source SDO which is to be compared to the database field in the Target, or CustNum in our case. This must be the name of the field as it occurs in the Data-Source SDO column list (no DB table qualification) because the Source SDO is providing that value from the SDO's temp-table, not straight out of the database. Each time the dataAvailable event is published by the Data-Source, indicating that its query on Customers has been re-positioned, the Data-Target (Order) SDO will request the value of the CustNum field from the Customer SDO and plug that into the Order query where clause as indicated above.

This is a comma-separated paired list of database field names in the Data-Target and RowObject Temp-Table fields in the Data-Source that should be used for opening the Data-Target's database query using one or more key values from the Data-Source.

A good example is joining a customer sdo with an order sdo and the foreign fields would be set to order.cust-num,cust-num.

For SBOs, the temp-table is not refered to as rowobject, but rather as the SDO name within the SBO. In this case, the 2nd part of each foreign field pair would be qualified with the sdo name.

Note that for each Foreign Field pair, the first entry is the name of the field in the database query for the Data-Target (the child or detail SDO in the parent-child or master-detail relationship), which is Order.CustNum in our example. This first entry is expressed as the database field name (optionally with the table qualifier) because that fieldname will actually be inserted into a where clause used to open the database query for the Data-Target, resulting in FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.CustNum = <CustNum-value-from-Data-Source>. The second entry in the pair is the name of the key field in the Data-Source SDO which is to be compared to the database field in the Target, or CustNum in our case. This must be the name of the field as it occurs in the Data-Source SDO column list (no DB table qualification unless SBO where we need an SDO qualification) because the Source SDO is providing that value from the SDO's temp-table, not straight out of the database. Each time the dataAvailable event is published by the Data-Source, indicating that its query on Customers has been re-positioned, the Data-Target (Order) SDO will request the value of the CustNum field from the Customer SDO and plug that into the Order query where clause as indicated above.

  DESCRIPTION "If the sdo_name is the child of some other data object and relies on parent key information from the parent data object to resolve its query, then the fields to map between the data objects should be specified in this property.

This is a comma-separated paired list of database field names in the Data-Target and RowObject Temp-Table fields in the Data-Source that should be used for opening the Data-Target's database query using one or more key values from the Data-Source.

A good example is joining a customer sdo with an order sdo and the foreign fields would be set to order.cust-num,cust-num.

For SBOs, the temp-table is not refered to as rowobject, but rather as the SDO name within the SBO. In this case, the 2nd part of each foreign field pair would be qualified with the sdo name.

Note that for each Foreign Field pair, the first entry is the name of the field in the database query for the Data-Target (the child or detail SDO in the parent-child or master-detail relationship), which is Order.CustNum in our example. This first entry is expressed as the database field name (optionally with the table qualifier) because that fieldname will actually be inserted into a where clause used to open the database query for the Data-Target, resulting in FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.CustNum = <CustNum-value-from-Data-Source>. The second entry in the pair is the name of the key field in the Data-Source SDO which is to be compared to the database field in the Target, or CustNum in our case. This must be the name of the field as it occurs in the Data-Source SDO column list (no DB table qualification unless SBO where we need an SDO qualification) because the Source SDO is providing that value from the SDO's temp-table, not straight out of the database. Each time the dataAvailable event is published by the Data-Source, indicating that its query on Customers has been re-positioned, the Data-Target (Order) SDO will request the value of the CustNum field from the Customer SDO and plug that into the Order query where clause as indicated above.
