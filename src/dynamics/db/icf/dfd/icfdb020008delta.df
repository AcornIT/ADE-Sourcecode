Its purpose is to be able to record session activity and manage the context for the session in the child table gsm_server_context. The session id field from gsm_server_context has transferred to this table, so it only exists in one place for the session, and the object id for the session record is rather carried down onto the individual context records. This facilitates efficiently fixing the context id in the event a session is dropped and reconnected, thereby restoring context for the new session from the old session. For the Appserver, a record will be created in this table at connection time and checked / updated in the activate procedure.
This table must not have a write trigger so that it can be updated as efficiently as possible.
The information in this table is all client related, and in the case of a WebSpeed Agent, the agent is also the client.

ADD TABLE "ryc_customization_result"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "The table is required to store possible customization codes as a result of some level of customization. Many types of customization exist, including UI type customizations (e.g. HTML, DHTML, GUI), user category customizations, user customizations, company level customizations, etc as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.  To avoid confusion and to provide some level of control as to the use of the result codes, a result code must be for a specific customization type.

The table will basically contain a code and description field. Meaningful codes and descriptions should be used to avoid conflicting uses of result codes. The table is also joined to the customization type to identify which type of customization the result code is for. 

For user level customizations, example result codes could be individual user login names, e.g. Bruce, Anthony, Don, etc. Alternatively the customization results could be defined rather by job function, e.g. operator, administrator, clerk, etc. For UI type customizations, the result codes could be DHTML, HTML, GUI, PDA, etc. For language customizations, the result codes could be English, French, German, etc. Another possibility is customizations by user category, in which case the result codes would represent valid categories, e.g. data capturer.

This provides maximum flexibility as to how much customization is required. 
The customization types simply define the various levels of supported customization, and the result codes define the possible values each customization type can be. The customization result table could therefore be viewed as a list of valid values for a customization type.
Certain result codes, such as supported UI type customizations will be provided as part of the framework. These result codes will be defined with a system owned flag set to YES, and maintenance of these codes will be restricted to users authorized to maintain system data. Care should be taken when defining these framework supplied result codes to avoid potential conflicts with result codes used by Dynamics applications.

ADD TABLE "rym_customization"
  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table captures the actual customization results for the various supported types of customization as defined in the ryc_customization_type table.

This table is joined from the ryc_customization_type table with a mandatory join to define the type of customization. It contains a customization_reference field as part of the unique key to store the value for the customization according to the type. For example, if this was a user level customization, then the reference field would contain a specific users login code. If this was a UI type customization, then the reference field would contain the value of a UI type, e.g. HTML, GUI, etc.

This differs from the values in the customization result table. The customization result table is a list of valid value result codes for the customization type. This table represents actual values that can be checked at runtime with the appropriate api and the values may differ to the result code values. The result code values are reusable.

For example, one customization type is user customization. In this customization table we could have a record for each user with the reference pointing at the user login name, e.g. Anthony, john, bruce, etc. The api specified for the customization type would be run to find the current user and lookup in this table what the specified result code is for the user. The result code for Anthony could be manager, and John could also point at the same result code, but Bruce may point at result code engineer. Note the possible reuse of result codes and the difference between the result code values and the customization references.

The table stores the result for the customization via a join to the customization result table, identifying the result code to use for this specific customization.
These tables then provide maximum flexibility for customization possibilities.
As stated previously, the resultant result codes for a session will be evaluated after authentication and made available to the session.

When reading from tables that support customization, e.g. the smartobject and related tables, the appropriate record will be read with a matching result code of the highest priority level, if any matching customizations exist, otherwise the default record will be used.

A generic tool will need to be developed to capture these customizations.

  AREA "Schema Area"
  DESCRIPTION "This table audits what DCU updates have occurred, and more importantly controls the DCU update beyond completion of the DCU, plus allows it to be re-run / re-started as required.

We need to be able to control and automate what tasks to do as part of the DCU for a specific release, at what stage they should be run, whether each step completed successfully, the order of the steps, etc.

Certain tasks can only occur after the DCU has finished, but before anybody starts using the system and the tasks require a valid login to complete. Currently we have no way of controlling or automating this, which is the primary reason for the table. This table will significantly improve the load-n-go functionality within Dynamics and help prevent migration and deployment issues.

The DCU will update this table from the information in the .pfl file that the DCU uses as the source of the information for the DCU.

ADD FIELD "version_master_entity" OF "gsc_entity_mnemonic" AS character
  DESCRIPTION "We need to identify which tables in the repository are master tables that must have version change information recorded in the gst_record_version table to be able to identify when data has changed and needs to be deployed.
We only need to track changes to master tables. For child data linked to a master table, it is the master record that must be recorded as being changed, not the child table. For example, in the case of repository objects, the ryc_smartobject table is the master table, and all related tables such as pages, links, etc. linked to this will point at the ryc_smartobject entity as the master table. Any modifications to any data in any of these child tables will result in an updated version record for the master ryc_smartobject table in gst_record_version highlighting this master object has changed. This is because it is assumed that any changes to child data of a master object are in fact changes to the master object itself. The changes to the master object and all its child data will be deployed in the dataset(s) defined for the master object.
This will save a lot of redundant data in the gst_record_version table. 
If the join is not specified, i.e. the field is blank, then this is a master entity, otherwise it must identify the master entity for this table.
The specification of this information is specifically for record versioning purposes.

  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the types of programs supported. A record will need to exist for the various support templates, e.g. ""Object Controller"", ""Menu Controller"", ""SmartFolder"", smartbrowser, smartviewer, smartdataobject, etc.

When objects are created, they must be assigned an object type.

The object type is used as a grouping mechanism for security, to allow restrictions to be created for certain types of objects, rather than having to setup security for every object.

A recursive join exists for the object type to facilitate definition of object type hierarchies (class hieararchies). This is then useful for attribute inheritance at multiple levels of object type.

For example, an object type could be defined for a fill-in, then a child of this may be an integer fill-in, then a child of this may be an object id, etc.

the extends object type means the inherit from object type.

UPDATE TABLE "gsm_session_type"
  DESCRIPTION "A session type is a namespace for grouping specific types of sessions together.

For example, a ""receipting workstation"" would be a specific session type while a ""salesman's web agent"" could be another.

Each session type is combined with a physical session type that maps to a list of known Progress 4GL run-time environments. 

Thus, ""receipting workstation"" may be mapped to a 4GL GUI client while ""salesman's web agent"" could be mapped to a WebSpeed Transaction Agent.

Thus you could create any number of session types mapping them to specific 4GL session types.

Where different managers, etc. need to be pre-started for different applications, then the different applications would be defined as new session types.

In order to run locally without appserver connections, etc. you would need to define a new session type that connects to appropriate databases and has no session service records for the appserver logical services thereby forcing them to not connect and rather simply use the session handle for code portability. Also, this new session type would define a different set of managers to run, i.e. run the server side managers locally.

We will provide a facility to change the session type on the fly (if possible).

We have a recursive join to the gsc_session_type table to support inheritance of settings across multiple session types. This will make the modification, re-use and creation of session types much simpler. The program that generates the icfconfig.xml file will simply read the extra details from the linked session types and write out an accumulated set of configuration details.

This table also holds parameter details for the session, such as whether to support failover and inactivity timeouts for sessions."

  DESCRIPTION "This will be a character field and will supplement the key_field_value. If the key_field_value contains an object id field, then this new field will contain the other unique key information for the table, otherwise it will be blank.
This will mean that where object ids are used for keys, we will also store some other unique key information about the table if available, that would have been used as an alternative by the deployment procedures to locate the record. For example, in the case of the ryc_smartobject table, the key_field_value will contain the smartobject_obj and the secondary_key_value will contain the actual object name.
We cannot make this field unique as it may not always be used, but it will be indexed together with the entity mnemonic. If the field is used for an entity, then code will prevent duplicate alternate key values as this should never occur due to the new data resurrection functionality this facilitates.
Triggers for master tables will check the gst_record_version table where the secondary field is used and see if a new record is being created with a previously used key value, and if so, will change the object id to match the previously used object id. This will ensure when resurrecting old data that the object id is never modified, and help prevent data conflicts when deploying data.

UPDATE TABLE "ryc_attribute"
  DESCRIPTION "This table defines the attributes that may be allocated to objects, e.g. size, position, window title, query, where clause, etc. They are used to defined the properties of dynamic objects, plus to dynamically alter the behaviour of static objects.

Certain attributes are required for the application to function correctly and these will be set to system owned to prevent accidental deletion. Only users that are classified as able to maintain system owned information may manipulate this data. In many (most) cases, the actual attribute label will need to match to a valid Progress supported attribute.

Due to the powerful feature of allowing attributes to be defined at various levels, most dynamic data about smartobjects will utilise attributes.

Example areas that we will utilise attributes for include browser query, sort order and where clauses, container window titles, which window to run based on various button actions in a browser, e.g. add, modify, view, etc., status bar configuration, page enabling and disabling, field enabling and disabling by object instance, whether toolbar items are included in the menu, etc.

If this field has a value, then the functions to get and/or set this property need to physically exist and be used and overrideable, to allow them to contain additionally logic beyond simply retrieving the value from ADM-DATA. This is the equivalent of defining the xp preprocessors in the ADM but is more flexible in that it differentiates between get and set.

It is the set calls that are most expensive at startup, so this is an important field.

Note that in code when checking this value, a CAN-FIND should be used to ensure the order of the get,set is irrelevant.

  DESCRIPTION "This entity associated attributes with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances, and specifies the value of the attribute in the appropriate native data type or character if a native data type is not available for the data type.

The list of attribute values defined for the object type (class) must be complete, and unless an attribute is defined at the class level, it will not be available to be set within a subclass. Attribute values are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the attribute values for an object, attributes for parent classes must also be read.

Records will then only exist for subclassess in the event the value has been specifically overridden for that subclass.

When creating entries in this table for attributes associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating attributes for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for attributes associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

The first character is ""M"" or ""B"" depending on whether this object is in the Main or Bottom section. The second character is a digit representing the row,  and the third character is a digit representing the left-to-right position or sequence within that row. The third character can also be a ""C"", meaning that the object should be centered within the row (or within the remaining available space in the row), or ""R"", meaning that the object should be right justified within the row.  SmartDataObjects and other non-visual objects are automatically assigned to row ""0"", since they do not actually appear in any way at runtime.
So for example, a window or page with a Toolbar at the top, and an SDO, followed by a Browser, under that a Viewer, and another Toolbar at the Bottom, would assign to those objects the layout positions ""M11"" for the toolbar, ""M01"" for the SDO, ""M21"" for the Browser, ""M31"" for the Viewer, and ""B11"" for the Bottom Toolbar. If you wanted the Viewer to be to the right of the Browser rather than underneath it, its position would be ""M22"""

Usually the name will match the object name of the datafield object, but may differ, e.g. where two tables exist in a single SDO with common fieldnames. The use of the name field therefore emulates the alias functionality that exists within SDO's.

The field is not forced unique for migration purposes and also to cope with scenarious where instance names need not be forced. Uniqueness of the name should however be forced in code where applicable, and the instance name should be defaulted to the object name of the instance.

UPDATE TABLE "ryc_smartobject"
  DESCRIPTION "This table represents every object known to the repository, whether static or dynamic. All objects that can be run should be registered in the repository, including all visual objects, business logic, etc. Images for buttons, etc. should also be registered.

The only files not registered in the repository are include files.

Having the files registered allows them to be added as instances to containers, added to menus, have security applied to them, run them as part of flows and events, automate deployment of them, etc.

Many child tables exist to further define an object, and which tables apply depend on the object type. For example, information regarding links, pages, instances, etc. only pertain to objects that are containers. Even with containers, not all tables may apply, as viewers, browsers, and sdo's are containers for datafields but do not have the concept of pages, only window containers have pages, links, etc.

Certain object properties are only applicable to physical objects. Previously this table was broken into two, and th second table, gsc_object used to define physical properties. This was removed in V2 to improve performance and resolve many issues associated with this, hence some redundant fields in certain object types.

For versioning to work, we have turned off RI that would have prevented an object being deleted if it is used on a container - this is to allow imports and object assignments to work. This RI must therefore be manually coded where required.

We turned off the automatic delete cascade of smartobject attributes as it was also deleting attributes for instances of the smartobject when we did not want it to. Added a specific delete trigger customisation that rather joined on the primary_smartobject_obj in the attribute table when deleting attributes, to ensure only attributes for the smartobject were deleted, not also instance attributes.

This table optionally supports customization using custom result codes.The unique key to this table is made up of the object filename and a result code, allowing the same object name to exist with multiple result codes, each custom object containing what behaviour has been added or overridden. The object with a 0 result code is the master default object, and this must always exist.

In this way, any of the fields on this table, plus information in tables where this is the parent may be customized by result code. Tools support for this however may be limited initially.

Whenever reading a smartobject based on the filename, the result code must also be specified, using 0 if looking for the master.

A recursive join with a rolename of extends_smartobject_obj has been added to this table to support inherritance. This functionality however as of V2 has not been implemented into the framework. The intention is to allow objects to inherit from (extend) other objects, therefore facilitating changes to master or template objects being cascaded down to subclasses or instances, by reading up the class structure.

For V2, the inherittance functionality has just been added at the object type level."

  DESCRIPTION "This entity stores information about UI events for a smartobject. It works very similar to the ryc_attribute_value table in that UI events can be associated with object types, smartobjects, and smartobject instances.

This allows the attachment of UI events to dynamic objects.

When creating entries in this table for events associated with an object type, then the smart object and instance will be 0.

When creating entries in the table for a smartobject, we will also populate the object type field to avoid having 0 in the key. Likewise when creating events for an object instance, we will populate the object type and the smartobject. This ensures effective use of the alternate keys.

Note: We must be careful when looking for events associated with an object type to ensure we look for the specific object type and 0 values for the smartobject and instance fields.

Events are not cascaded down to subclassess and entries will only exist at subclass levels for overrides. To read all the events for an object, events for parent classes must also be read."
