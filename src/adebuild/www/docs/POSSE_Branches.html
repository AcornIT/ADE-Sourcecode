<P CLASS="PageTitle">POSSE CVS Branches</P>

<SPAN CLASS="Text1">

<P>In order to facilitate concurrent development, the POSSE source
code will have multiple paths of development. Each path of development
will follow a separate CVS branch or set of branches. During the life
cycle of a given POSSE release, the most current code will exist on
different branches as described below.  A number of CVS tags will be
used to mark milestones in the life cycle of a POSSE release.</P>

<P>In CVS, branches are defined as a special kind of CVS tag. In
addition to branch tags, CVS has a class of tags that are plain marker
tags.  Plain marker tags should be used to mark milestones in the life
cycle of a given release.  In order to aid in visually distinguishing
branch tags from plain marker tags, I propose that branch tags use
only lowercase letters and plain marker tags use all uppercase
letters.  In summary. branch tags represent a separate path or line of
development, while marker tags exist to mark a state, or milestone in
the development path.</P>

<P>In addition to the POSSE specific tags, there are two built-in CVS
tags that should be described, HEAD and MAIN. The HEAD marker tag is a
always located at the newest committed revision on the MAIN branch of
a specific file's or directories' version tree.  From that
description, I hope it is obvious that HEAD is a plain marker tag, and
that MAIN is a branch tag. In this case the MAIN branch tag deviates
from my proposed naming convention of lowercase letters for branch
tags.</P>

<P>The life cycle of each POSSE release will have two major phases,
&quot;active development&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot;. When a
POSSE release is in the &quot;active development&quot; phase, the
POSSE release will be open to new feature additions and bug fix
changes. When a POSSE release is in the &quot;maintenance&quot; phase,
only bug fix changes can be checked in. Since the key difference
between the &quot;active development&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot;
phases is the ability to add new features, the &quot;active
development&quot; phase will also be known as the &quot;features&quot;
phase. The transition between the two phases is traditionally called a
&quot;Code Freeze&quot; and is a major milestone in the life cycle of
a POSSE release.</P>

<P>For the POSSE project, the &quot;active development&quot; or
&quot;features&quot; phase is synonymous with the CVS MAIN branch.
The duration of time when a given version of POSSE is open for new
feature additions, check-ins that occur on the MAIN branch will be
included in that release of POSSE. The only exception to that rule is
if a new feature addition is backed out of a POSSE release due to
whatever reason. In order to prevent regressions, bug fix changes
should also be checked in to the MAIN branch, in addition to any
specific &quot;maintenance&quot; branch.  Unless you specify
otherwise, CVS will perform actions on the MAIN branch, and hence the
&quot;active development&quot; area.</P>

<P>The point in time when a release of POSSE is closed to further
feature additions, traditionally called &quot;Code Freeze&quot;, is
when that POSSE version's development path forks onto a new branch.
To mark the transition from &quot;active development&quot; to
&quot;maintenance&quot; a CVS tag will be placed on the current
revisions of all POSSE elements to mark this milestone.  The CVS tag's
name will be based on the specific release of POSSE, and will serve as
the basis for the maintenance branch.  The maintenance branch will be
described below.  The naming structure for this CVS tag is
POSSE_[version]_BASE.</P>

<P>The &quot;maintenance&quot; phase of a POSSE release will always
occur on a branch other than MAIN. This branch will be known as the
&quot;maintenance&quot; branch and it is POSSE version specific. Only
bug fixes are to be included in a POSSE release under maintenance. The
maintenance branch names will follow the pattern, posse_[version].
When a POSSE release transitions to the &quot;maintenance&quot; phase,
it then becomes the current maintenance release, replacing any
previous maintenance release. Where the MAIN branch is always the new
feature branch, the maintenance branch will change over time as new
versions of POSSE are begun.</P>

<P>For Example:</P>

<P>Two versions of POSSE are currently available, V1.0 and
V2.0. Version 1.0 is the current POSSE maintenance version, and
version 2.0 is the active development or new features version. The
following CVS version tree is representative of the current state of
POSSE files.</P>

<P>The numbers represent the underlying RCS/CVS revision numbers.
<BR>The words represent CVS tags.
<BR>Comments are in parentheses.

<PRE>
<BR>
<BR>                  1.3.2.1----1.3.2.2----1.3.2.3 (Maintenance Branch)
<BR>                 /
<BR>                /
<BR>               /
<BR>1.1----1.2----1.3------------1.4----1.5         (New Features Branch)
<BR>MAIN          posse_10              HEAD
<BR>              POSSE_10_BASE
<BR>
<BR>
</PRE>

<P>For this file, the revision 1.3 was the beginning of the POSSE 1.0
maintenance branch, posse_10.  The 1.3 revision has two tags, the
POSSE_10_BASE tag to mark the base revision for the posse_10 branch,
and the posse_10 branch tag itself. In RCS/CVS, the revision numbers
given to a branch consists of a second pair of numbers, which is why
the revisions on the posse_10 branch have four numbers separated by
dots, where as the revisions on the MAIN branch only have two numbers.
Please read the RCS documentation for more information on revision
numbering.</P>

<P>What does this mean for POSSE developers:</P>

<P>For each path of development that you want work on, you should
setup the local CVS directory with the appropriately checked out
revisions.</P>

<P>To create a POSSE new features workspace</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Make a directory for my POSSE new features work
      <BR><code>mkdir -p posse_features/src</code>
  </LI>
  <LI>Change into that directory
      <BR><code>cd posse_features/src</code>
  </LI>
  <LI>Check out the POSSE code from HEAD revision, which is the default.
      <BR><code>cvs co posseall</code>
      <BR><b>NOTE:</b> The command line above is equivalent to
      <BR><code>cvs co -r HEAD posseall</code>
      <BR>or
      <BR><code>cvs co -r MAIN posseall</code>
  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To create a POSSE V1.0 maintenance workspace</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Make a directory for my POSSE 10 workspace
      <BR><code>mkdir -p posse_10/src</code>
  </LI>
      
  <LI>Change into that directory
      <BR><code>cd posse_10/src</code>
  </LI>
      
  <LI>Check out the POSSE code from the posse_10 branch tag
      <BR><code>cvs co -r posse_10 posseall</code>
      <BR>&nbsp;
      <BR><b>NOTE:</b> To work on changes that would be going into the
posse_10 branch, you would need to check out the POSSE code from the
posse_10 tag. CVS branch tags are &quot;<i>sticky</i>&quot;, all
further CVS operations on files under this CVS directory will work on
the posse_10 branch instead of the MAIN branch.  Please read the CVS
documentation for more information.
