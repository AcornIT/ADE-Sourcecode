<A NAME="1"><B>1. Overview</B></A> 
</P>

<P>
The AppBuilder temp-tables comprise the core of the
AppBuilder tool. All of the information
needed to generate a procedure file is stored in these tables. Some of the temp-tables are used to support
the various functions of AppBuilder such as Extended Features (XFTRs),
Alternate Layouts and HTML-mapping.
Others are used to hold the properties and methods of interface
objects. This document describes the
different temp-tables used by AppBuilder and their interrelationships.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="1">2. Architecture</B></A> 
</P>

<P>
The data model that supports the AppBuilder tool has
evolved since the tool’s inception in 1992, as improvements were made and new
functionality was introduced. The
relationships between tables can be complex in some cases, so care should be
taken when examining and modifying the tables and the code that references
them. The key to understanding the
behavior of AppBuilder lies in understanding these temp-tables and how they
relate to one another.
</P>

<P>
Volumes could be written about how these tables are used
throughout the AppBuilder environment, and many of the other Open Source
documents may discuss the specific uses of their dependent tables, so this
document will only attempt to briefly describe each table’s purpose and
relationship to the overall data model.
</P>





<P>
<A NAME="2.1">2.1 Table Relationships</B></A> 
</P>

<P>
The
following diagram shows the manner in which AppBuilder’s internal temp-tables
are related, and what fields are used to relate them. Please note that the symbols used in the diagram are only meant
to express the basic nature of the actual temp-table structure, and do not
necessarily represent any formal Entity-Relationship standard methodology, such
as IDEF1X. The nature of AppBuilder’s
table relationships is primarily hierarchical vs. relational: tables contain
fields that contain the RECIDs of other tables. In this sense, a given table (such as the _U table) can be
extended by pointing to the address (or RECID) of another table. There are also cases where two tables can be
related in a one-to-many fashion: many records in the _TRIG table can be
related to a single _U record (i.e., an interface widget with several UI
triggers). The _TRIG records would
contain the RECID of the corresponding _U table in their _wRecid fields.

<P>
The
diagram is intended to provide a high-level view of the table relationships;
further inspection of the temp-tables themselves is necessary to understand
their specific properties and linkage.
